#👾 - Hello World!

My name is Tomflame, I'm a 18 year old Colombian guy that likes interesting productivity and personalization projects to try on my Windows 11 PC

#🧑🏻‍💻 - My Projects

Im currently working on a project called MouseHK, an AutoHotkey script for controlling the cursor and do all the actions of a normal mouse from the keyboard.

#🧠 - My Knowledge

I actually don't know properly how to code in specific languages, but I'm learning and working with Google Antigravity, an AI-first IDE very capable, I know the basics of proggramming so I guide the AI trough all the process, the features that I want, the bugs that need to be fixed and the explanations I need to comprehend all the functioning of my projects.

#👍 - My Apports

I'm looking to collaborate on different projects that look interesting to me, normally about productivity tools or Power User personalization on Windows 11

#🙏 - Your Contribution

I'm open to everyone for apporting contributions to my projects or my ideas, I'll be glad to understand their reasons, their implementations and their awesome ideas.
