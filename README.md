# 👾 Hello World!

I'm Tomflame, an 18-year-old Colombian passionate about testing and improving productivity tools. I actively contribute ideas, test features deeply, and suggest implementations to projects I love—especially automation and Windows customization.

## 👍 What I Do

I'm actively looking to contribute to projects related to:
- **Productivity tools and automation** — testing features, identifying edge cases, suggesting improvements
- **Windows 11 customization & Power User workflows** — exploring what's possible, sharing ideas
- **Automation scripts & tools** — collaborating on implementations and real-world use cases

I love working with maintainers to understand their vision and helping shape how features work in practice.

## 🔧 My Approach

I don't just use tools—I deeply test them. I work with **Google Antigravity** (an AI-first IDE) to prototype ideas, experiment with implementations, and articulate what I'm trying to achieve. This lets me bring detailed feedback, concrete suggestions, and working examples to the projects I collaborate on.

## 🎯 Current Projects & Interests

I'm actively developing and testing **MouseHK**, an AutoHotkey script that transforms your keyboard into a high-precision mouse controller. It's a perfect example of my approach: taking an idea, building it, testing edge cases, and iterating based on real-world usage.

I'm always exploring new productivity projects to test and contribute to.

## 📥 Contributing & Collaboration

I'm genuinely interested in understanding how projects work and how they could work better. If you're building tools for productivity or automation, I'd love to:
- Test your features and report detailed feedback
- Suggest ideas for implementation
- Collaborate on improvements
- Share my experience using your project
